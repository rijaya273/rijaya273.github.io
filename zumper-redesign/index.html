        </h2>

        <p class="summary">
          As part of my Kleiner Perkins Design Fellows application, I redesigned a feature from an associated startup, Zumper, an end-end marketplace for tenants and brokers/landlords. Based on what I could easily access, I choose to redesign the listing exploration feature to be more adaptable to the complexities of finding a space to live in. In addition, I explored possibilities to further establish product goals through the primary facing application. <br>

<p>While the stress, excitement and emotional complexities of finding a place to live in are hard to emulate without first-hand experience, performing a deep dive into listing exploration features and a few too many NYC apartment hunting YouTube videos allowed me to grasp the problem Zumper is trying to solve.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ZUMPER/explore.jpeg" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>At face value, Zumper is an application to assist and reduce stressors throughout the process of renting, whether that&rsquo;s browsing listings, matching specific criteria, verifying legitimacy, or signing a lease. However, by reading various articles on the nature of listing platforms such as Zumper and Zillow, brokerage firms and the complexities that come with digitizing the real estate market, it became apparent that the problem Zumper is solving is obviously not as linear as it appears to the average consumer. The following thus became the guiding principle for establishing redesign opportunities:</p>

<p><img src="/img/ZUMPER/principle.jpeg" alt="image_text" /></p>

<p>Listing various jobs to be done and emotional counterparts made it even more evident that the nonlinear process of renting is complex and messy, a problem space that Zumper hopes to tidy up:</p>

<h4 id="understanding-differentiating-factors-in-digital-real-estate">understanding differentiating factors in digital real estate</h4>

<p><img src="/img/ZUMPER/analysis.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>Examining similar platforms such as Zillow and StreetEasy, alongside less modern but still used platforms like Craigslist allowed a further understanding of what Zumper hopes to do. Some key takeaways were:</p>

<ul>
<li>The basic listings feature is not a unique feature to any one platform. <b>This is where presentation and holistic solutions are differentiators.</b></li>
<li>There are obvious trends being applied across platforms, such as price being highlighted in listing previews.</li>
<li>The primary methods of exploring listings is either through location (map) views or through more traditional lists.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is often perceived that the myriad of platforms serve the same purpose. As a result, <span class = "bluehighlight">a successful redesign will address opportunities that aid to differentiate Zumper as a solution to the entire renting process.</span> Or in other words, the presentation of features should help reduce the following pessimism:</p>

<h4 id="generalizing-the-listing-exploration-experience">generalizing the listing exploration experience</h4>

<p>One of the key principles in designing an application for a hollistic process is considering it&rsquo;s variations. Based on the complexities of different journeys in the renting process, listing exploration is an opportunity for clarity and customizability. As a result, the redesign invoked the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>custom modular spaces</li>
<li>an emphasis on the filters-results relationship</li>
<li>clear correlation between map and cards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Minimizing the amount of elements and instruction required for resizing and hiding is part of the solution, but further exploration into default views and audience-familiar gestures would be required to incorporate other factors. <span class = "highlight">This interpretation focuses on juggling both clear, visual instruction and a freeform space for exploration. </span></p>

<h3 id="opportunity-ii">Opportunity II</h3>

<h4 id="generating-trust-for-user-investment">generating trust for user investment</h4>

<p>Based on various reviews, it is apparent that having security in your rental process is an essential. As a result, creating a space of trust through visual means is an opportunity for constant improvement, not for a sense of &ldquo;false security&rdquo;, but rather to encourage a system filled with &ldquo;good actors&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ZUMPER/wary.jpeg" width="45%"" /></p>

<p>Throughout all the screens I made, I sought to apply more:</p>

<ul>
<li>visual coherence</li>
<li>emphasis on trustworthy features (ie. verification provided by Instarent)</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, I applied more similar styles between search filters and label results via the colour system:</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center"><img src="/img/ZUMPER/Frame 6.png" alt="Image" /></td>
<td align="center"><img src="/img/ZUMPER/Frame 5.png" alt="Image" /></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><h6>former pairing between label and filter</h6></td>
<td align="center"><h6>new pairing</h6></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><span class = "highlight"  >By minimizing the visual gap between elements and placing reinforcement on the colour palette used, I hoped to create a space where certain features such as &ldquo;verified properties&rdquo; and &ldquo;no brokers fees&rdquo; are at the very front of the user experience.</span> This was done via a reduction of corner radius, typography and selection item variants, alongside a intentional increase in colour application.</p>

<h4 id="establishing-product-precedents">establishing product precedents</h4>

<p>One of the differentiators between Zumper and other competitors is the aim to be an end-end marketplace. Although there could possibly be a lot more features to be implemented, establishing a clear relationship between two parties is important in creating the right environment. However, there is often the drawback of distracting from the actual job to be done (in this case, finding a place to rent). For example, creating call to actions to mitigate the below steps would reinforce the other side of the equation (landlords/brokers), but that would likely be at the expense of cluttering the current navigation.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ZUMPER/process.jpeg" alt="image_text" /></p>

<p>To counterbalance that, <span class = "highlight">I explored editing the listing display hierarchy to reinforce the importance of landlord-renter relationships.</span></p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center"></th>
<th align="center"></th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center"><img src="/img/ZUMPER/longone.jpeg" width="35%"" /></td>
<td align="center"><img class = "shadow" src="/img/ZUMPER/moving up.png" width="65%"" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Although it is for sure just scratching the surface of a long series of solutions to a complicated problem, it was interesting to <span class = "highlight">consider influencing the perception of what Zumper is via front-facing presentation. </span></p>

<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>

<h4 id="next-steps-and-lessons-learned">next steps and lessons learned</h4>

<p>Designing for opportunities in response to Zumper&rsquo;s public facing goals and ideals was by no means an easy task. <span class = "bluehighlight"> Although limited by the scope of the project, the opportunities I tackled did take into consideration the progressive idea of making Zumper more than just another listing site</span>.</p>

<p>While most of my time was budgeted for thinking about how the exploration feature fits into the entire product as a whole, I did not counterbalance that aspect with <b>usability</b>. Time spent usability testing would have determined if my ideas were too cluttered and if customizability spaces is a feasible idea. Furthermore, all of my designs were based on rather generalist principles. Having more direct insights via user research and <b>stronger understanding of the market space</b> would have definitely helped in creating more concrete courses of action.</p>

<p>The Kleiner Perkins redesign challenge was definitely a great exercise in applying my design toolkit in response to product insight and interpretation.</p>
