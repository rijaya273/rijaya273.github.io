        <h2 class="subtitle">ODS Lab, exploring single sign-on design</h2>

        <p class="summary">Public secure is a government team that leads the initiative to create single sign-on for online applications across the government of Ontario. As the consulting team, we introduced user-centric design by demonstrating the importance of research and synthesis, while developing discovery phase insights and prototype screens.</p>

<p></p>

<p><span class="bluehighlight"><strong>13 stakeholders</strong></span>  were interviewed, which were all different program areas that have the potential to implement better single sign-on.</p>

<p><strong>Key takeaways</strong> from analyzing the existing user flows:</p>

<ul>
<li>login frustrations stem from confusing onboarding processes &amp; a lack of hierarchy in the presentation of information.</li>
<li>relatively small application access frequency further accentuates frustration upon login.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to understanding the problem space and creating a basis for further insight, stakeholder analysis yielded the following four themes to be examined in end users, <span class="bluehighlight">which in turn shaped the conversations regarding the possible approaches to single sign-on</span>:</p>

<ul>
<li>terminology comprehension</li>
<li>security perceptions</li>
<li>account attitudes</li>
<li>government participation</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, <span class="bluehighlight"><strong>12 end users</strong></span>  from the general public were interviewed. Analyzing their various characteristics and views resulted in the following spectrum:</p>

<p><img src="/img/PS/synthesis.jpeg" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>As a result of what we learned via stakeholder and user interviews, it was determined that all ranges of the spectrums must be considered. Thus, for this discovery phase of Public Secure, <span class="bluehighlight">designing for generality</span> is the guiding principle for success.</p>

<p>Sam, Alex &amp; Jamie stray from typical personas. They help illustrate the principle of <span class="bluehighlight"> designing for generality</span>, rather than pinpoint a specific user group the problem is being solved for. Thus, considering the edge cases was the overarching guidance we used to design for all. This was done by considering a variety of user flows and exploring feature sets of different user groups.</p>

<h3 id="prototyping-and-evaluating">Prototyping and Evaluating</h3>

<h4 id="materializing-and-testing-ideas">materializing and testing ideas</h4>

<p>After conducting generative research, we mapped out our general
understanding of what flows needed to be demonstrated in the
discovery phase. The initial interpretation were these 4 core scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>enrolment as a net new user</li>
<li>enrollment as returning single sign-on</li>
<li>logging in to application area</li>
<li>password reset</li>
</ul>

<p>Illustrating the nuances of these scenarios:</p>

<h2 id="some-key-changes-made-throughout-several-iterations">Some key changes made throughout several iterations:</h2>

<p></p>

<p><strong><span class = "highlight"> Presentation of sign in options &amp; information presentation:</span></strong></p>

<p><img src="/img/PS/proto1.jpg" alt="proto" /></p>

<p>It was important to strike a balance between presenting enough information and not overwhelming the general majority.</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimizing callout verbiage created for more seamless skims.</li>
<li>Opting for radio buttons provided a more comprehensive direction for Ontarians to take.</li>
<li><strong>Striking the right balance was essential to design for generality.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong><span class = "highlight"> The order of application enrolment:</span></strong></p>

<p><img src="/img/PS/proto2.jpg" alt="proto" /></p>

<p>A series of twelve usability tests helped determine that expected screens should come as soon as possible, rather than later.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reordering account creation and enrolment pins for the latter to come first was an essential change</li>
<li><strong>It was important to consider general orientation within flows to cater to everyone.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong><span class = "highlight"> Reimagining onboard architecture:</span></strong></p>

<p><img src="/img/PS/proto3.jpg" alt="proto" /></p>

<p>The initial setup of having sign-in options presented upfront was problematic in that it was interpreted as different account types.</p>

<ul>
<li>Changing account order allowed the presentation of sign-in options to truly be presented as options.</li>
<li>This was the desired product model upon learning of <strong>the user need for control over account variables.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="communicating-concepts">communicating concepts</h4>

<p>Although this was a discovery phase project, the scenarios we explored were effective nonetheless in establishing principles for further takes on single sign-on design. Qualitative success was found via communicating generalist principles for single sign-on design.</p>

<p>In addition to the <strong>12 total scenarios</strong> we prototyped, some key learnings we delivered during handoff were:</p>

<h3 id="personal-learnings">Personal Learnings</h3>

<h4 id="takeaways">takeaways</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Establishing higher level questions &amp; analogies for mental models is
super valuable to asking users the right generative questions.</p></li>

<li><p>Discovery phase projects give opportunity to dabble in lots of
design processes in-depth, generative and evaluative.</p></li>

<li><p>Content design is a LOT more than just the effective
words. Projects such as Public secure are dysfunctional without
well thought out content and navigation. Although this might
imply frustrating debates over subtle nuances, it&rsquo;s well worthwhile!</p></li>
</ul>
