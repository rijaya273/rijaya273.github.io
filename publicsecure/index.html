<h3 id="understanding">Understanding</h3>

<h4 id="establishing-context">establishing context</h4>

<p>The currently deployed sign-on systems, ONe-key and Public Secure Pilot, have not met the expectations of the Ontario government&rsquo;s program areas, as shown by high call centre volumes and low adoption rates of digital services. From that point of understanding, we then conducted research with program area stakeholders and members of the public to tangibly define existing problems and public expectations respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Stakeholder insight</strong></p>

<p>13 stakeholders were interviewed, whom were all members of different program areas that have the potential to implement a better single sign-on system.</p>

<table>

<td align="center"><img src="/img/PS/Stakeholders-Legend.jpeg" alt="Image" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Key takeaways from analyzing the existing user flows:</p>

<ul>
<li>login frustrations stem from confusing onboarding processes and a lack of hierarchy in the presentation of information.</li>
<li>relatively small application access frequency further accentuates frustration upon login.</li>
<li>although the job to be done is effectively application access, different program areas nuances require consideration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stakeholder interviews created a basis for understanding the problem space and further insight, which was then taken into consideration for generative research with members of the public.</p>

<p><strong>End user insight</strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, 12 potential end users from the general public were interviewed. Analyzing their various characteristics and views resulted in the below spectrum, considering the following attributes that were decided on via stakeholder knowledge gaps:</p>

<ul>
<li>system expectations</li>
<li>government participation</li>
<li>technology reception and comprehension</li>
<li>account attitudes</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="generating-guidance-and-defining-success">generating guidance and defining success</h4>

<p><img src="/img/PS/synthesis2.jpeg" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>As a result of what we learned via stakeholder and user interviews, it was determined that all ranges of the spectrums must be considered. Thus, for the discovery phase of Public Secure, <span class="bluehighlight">designing for generality was the guiding principle for success.</span></p>

</tbody>

<p>To further display <strong><em>designing for generality</em></strong> as a guide for success, vague personas were drawn out for purpose of tangible illustration. Rather than pinpoint a specific user group the problem is being solved for, this particular persona exercise emphasized the consideration of the many edge cases. This frame of mind was then applied by considering a variety of user flows and different user groups, translating them to subsequent feature sets.</p>

<p>Highlighting some key changes made throughout several iterations via stakeholder and usability test feedback:</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Presentation of sign in options &amp; other information:</strong>
<img src="/img/PS/change1.png" alt="eighty" /></p>

<!--
|                                         |                                         |                                         |

<p>It was important to strike a balance between presenting enough information and not overwhelming the general majority. This was based on the fact that there are users whom are very familiar with government processes and sign-in technology, and those whom are less so.</p>

<ul>
<li>Opting for radio buttons provided a more comprehensive and direct instruction for Ontarians.</li>
<li>Minimizing callout verbiage created for more seamless skimming.</li>
<li><em><span class = "bluehighlight">Striking the right balance was essential to design for generality.</span></em></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong>The order of application enrolment:</strong>
<img src="/img/PS/change2.png" alt="nothing" /></p>

<p>A series of twelve usability tests helped determine that expected screens should come as soon as possible, rather than later. This emulates expected patterns in order to establish more trust in government systems and set the stage for more technology receptiveness. In addition, this decision sought to contribute to a sense of control for those on the more wary side of the security spectrum.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reordering account creation and enrolment pins for the latter to come first was an essential change.</li>
<li><em><span class = "bluehighlight">It was important to consider how general orientation within flows will cater to everyone.</span></em></li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Reimagining onboard architecture:</strong>
<img src="/img/PS/change3.png" alt="nothing" /></p>

<p>The initial setup of having sign-in options presented upfront was problematic in that it was interpreted as different account types.</p>

<ul>
<li>Changing account order allowed the presentation of sign-in options as a setting within an account, rather than the defining attribute of the account.</li>
<li>This was the desired product model upon learning of <em><span class = "bluehighlight">the user need for control over account variables</span></em>, a consideration needed for all ends of the spectrums, as mentioned prior.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="delivery">Delivery</h3>

<h4 id="communicating-concepts">communicating concepts</h4>

<p>Although this was a discovery phase project, the scenarios we explored were effective nonetheless in establishing principles for further takes on single sign-on design. <span class="bluehighlight">Qualitative success was found by communicating generalist principles for single sign-on design</span>, which we found would accommodate for the vast user group that is the general public. The delivery of the project was (albeit subjectively), well received.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the iterations and usability tests, it was demonstrated that by catering towards individual comments and opinions, the final product veered towards one that was more digestible for users on all parts of the spectrums.</p>

<p>In addition to the 12 total scenarios we prototyped, some of the key findings we delivered during handoff were:</p>

<h3 id="personal-learnings">Personal Learnings</h3>

<h4 id="takeaways">takeaways</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Establishing higher level questions &amp; analogies for mental models is super valuable to asking users the right generative questions.</p></li>

<li><p>Discovery phase projects give opportunity to dabble in lots of design processes in-depth, generative and evaluative.</p></li>

<li><p>Content design is a LOT more than just the effective words. Projects such as Public secure are dysfunctional without well thought out content and navigation. Although this might imply frustrating debates over subtle nuances, it is a well worthwhile exercise to apply throughout public service!</p></li>
