<h3 id="problem-discovery">Problem Discovery</h3>

<h4 id="finding-a-door-to-open">finding a door to open</h4>

<p>To begin learning what questions to ask, we started by breaking down the challenge prompt:</p>

<p><img src="/img/COLLECTIVE/Challenge prompt.jpeg" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>While we looked at other subspaces involving the inclusion of groups with disabilities, we eventually decided on exploring the barriers to inclusion for those with mental health disabilities.</p>

<h3 id="investigation">Investigation</h3>

<h4 id="getting-a-foot-in-the-door">getting a foot in the door</h4>

<p>Although we were constrained by time and resources, we conducted <strong>7 generative interviews</strong>. Placing emphasis on designing for the barriers to inclusivity allowed us to not only focus on people with mental health difficulties. This converted into interviews with any and all users with thoughts on the state of the mental health-inclusion space.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Key takeaways</span> converted into <span class="bluehighlight">primary spaces</span> to consider while designing:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="/img/COLLECTIVE/takeaways.jpeg" alt="image_text" /></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Though there are a lot of other possible subspaces to explore within the mental health and inclusion, a focus on conversations was chosen due to frequent appearance in generative notes, in addition to the broader possibilities of engage with said subspace through a sample audience. Furthermore, due to the nature of a 24 hour exercise, <span class = "bluehighlight"> the success of our designs was limited to subjective thoroughness of covering the above spaces, </span> hence the functional approach taken.</p>

<h3 id="function-exploration-i">Function Exploration I</h3>

<h4 id="designing-places-from-subspaces">designing places from subspaces</h4>

<p>The first function tackled within the application was created as a response to a need for thoughtful reflection on the subject matter.</p>

<p><img src="/img/COLLECTIVE/explore1.jpeg" alt="image_text" /></p>

<p>Via the generative notes on thoughtful reflection, we noted that the design should:</p>

<ul>
<li>encourage meaningful thinking and dialogue.</li>
<li>allow conversation to organically flourish.</li>
<li>be impactful beyond the application space.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the details designed to support it&rsquo;s intended functionality, the home page was heavily iterated on to set up the idea of seeking stories, one of the two intended actions to be taken:</p>

<p><img src="/img/COLLECTIVE/explore3.jpeg" alt="image_text" /></p>

<p>Based on thoughts from various individuals, it was noted that this form of publishing must:</p>

<ul>
<li>give individuals control over privacy and descriptions.</li>
<li>create a blank canvas for individual experssion.</li>
</ul>

<p>To further the vision of creating a freeform space, visual consideration was itereated on and considered:</p>

<p><img src="/img/COLLECTIVE/explore2.jpeg" alt="image_text" /></p>

<p>In order to create a place where users can intentionally find themselves in others&rsquo; stories, it was important to craft a place to do so that does not feel limiting and fosters community:</p>

<table>

<td><img class = "shadow" src="/img/COLLECTIVE/Search Page.png" width="25%"" /></td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td><h6>free-forms allow for unbounded filters of stories.</h6></td>
<td><h6>cohesive visuals convey intentional community.</h6></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Specific to striking a balance between visual neatness and unconstrained filtering, the following was done:</p>

<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>

<h4 id="looking-forward">looking forward</h4>

<p>By designing features as direct answers to pseudo-researched spaces, our proposed solution to the challenge prompt quite throughly explored one possible method to tackling exclusion of people with mental health disabilities. Taking a functinoal approach had it&rsquo;s benefits in creating throughness in the solution, which was well suited to a 24 hour exercise.</p>

<p>With more time and resources, further exploration could have been done in other solutions spaces, possibly more organically for better idea development.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there was also room for improvement in the actual work done:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> while visuals were well-intended for cleanliness, the soft pastels are likely inaccessible to a wider audience, which should have been considered from the beginning.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Integration:</strong> from a product thinking standpoint, it was easy to default to a standalone app due to the nature of the twenty-four hour exercise, further integration could be thought out to make Collective part of a greater, holistic solution.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Collective was a great exercise to go through in both understanding a problem space in as much depth and speed as possible, in addition to practicing quick execution of visual prototyping.</p>
